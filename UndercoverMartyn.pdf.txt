Abstract. This article reviewsliteratureandsummarizesexperimentstoinvestigatethe
extent to which productivity of tropical montane rain forests is constrained by low nutrientsupply. On any one mountain, with increase in altitude foliar N decreases, and P and Kusually decrease, but Ca and Mg show no consistent trend. However for a wide range ofsites N, P, K, Mg, and Ca show no trends. Litterfall contents of N and P and often K, Ca,and Mg are lower in montane forests than in lowland forests, mainly because of reducedlitterfall mass, but N and P concentrations are also lower in forests above 1500 m. Tropicalmontane soils usually have more soil organic matter per unit ground area; N mineralizationlevels are lower at higher altitudes in Costa Rica, and extractable and total soil P are lowerin sites with lower litterfall P concentrations. We speculate that many lowland forests arelimited by P and many montane forests by N.

INTRODUCTION
Among the many factors that vary from lowland to
montane tropical forests, decreasing air temperatureand increasing cloudiness are probably ultimatelyÐand may be primarilyÐresponsible for limiting thegrowth and distribution of tropical montane forests(Grubb 1977). Nutrient supply and other factors suchas soil saturation are also controlled by temperatureand precipitation and may be simultaneously and evenproximally limiting. This articleinvestigatestheextentto which the productivity of montane tropical forest isconstrained by low nutrient availability. We brie¯y re-view observational evidence and concentrate on recentexperimentalstudieswhereforestshavebeenfertilized.We attach particular importance to these experimental

tion of causation.
Limitation by a nutrient is shown if the rate of an
ecosystem process is increased by addition of that nu-trient, and strictly speaking it can only be determinedexperimentally. Importantly, limitation can be seen inthe response of organisms that already occupy a site,or only after colonization by organisms that are betterable to make use of the added resource (Chapin et al.1986, Berendse 1993). Furthermore while overall eco-
system processes may be nutrient limited, not all spe-cies in the ecosystem need be limited; indeed evenwithin a species some individuals could be limited andothers not, due, for example, to different crown ex-posure. Finally, the observation that a nutrient is lim-iting does not mean that only that nutrient limits theecosystemÐsimultaneous limitation by multiple re-sources is the rule (Bloom et. al. 1980, Field et al.1992),especiallywithdifferenttypesofresources(e.g.,January 1998 11 TROPICAL MONTANE FORESTS

resourceslikeNorP,andnon-depletableresourceslikeCO
2).
It will always be easier to assess the nutrient status
of sites or individual trees by measurements, such asfoliar and litter concentrations or soil chemical ex-tracts, rather than by experimentation. In general, nu-trient limitation of growth is correlated with low con-centrations of the limiting nutrient in leaves and leaflitter (and often wood and roots); the low litter con-centrations are a result of low leaf concentrations andsometimes (but not always) higher rates of retranslo-cation of nutrients from leaves during senescence.There are important exceptions to the generalizationthat nutrient limitation should result in low concentra-tions of the limiting nutrient in plant parts. This isespecially true for N; extra N can cause extra growthbut no change in N concentration (e.g., Healey 1989).Soil chemical extracts are more dif®cult to interpretthan leaf and litter concentrations, but sometimes lowlevels of nutrients extracted with mild extractants(wa-ter, dilute salt solutions) are indicative of nutrient lim-itation. Forsoils,comparabilitybetweenstudiesislim-itedbythemanydifferentextractantsusedforthesamenutrient. Despite these limitations it is important tolook for correlations between leaf, litter, and soil nu-trients on the one hand and fertilizer responses on theother.

HANGES IN FORESTSTRUCTURE ON ASCENDING
WETTROPICAL MOUNTAINS
The average trend in the wet tropics is for forests to
decrease in stature, growth, and productivity with in-crease in altitude, but there is much variation at anygivenaltitudeduetodifferencesinnutrientavailability,wateravailability,andspeciescomposition.Inthelow-lands the forests range in canopy height (excludingemergents) from a few meters (Bana forest in southernVenezuela) to 40 m tall (in many parts of lowlandSoutheast Asia). In the mountains, up to 2500 m inaltitude, forests can be up to 30±35 m tall. Only above3000 m are forests with canopy heights
.30 m absent;
even at 3370 m there is a forest with a canopy heightof 22 m (in Colombia; Veneklaas 1991).

OLIARNUTRIENTS
Onanyonemountainsystemwithincreaseinaltitude
there is usually a decreaseinconcentrations(onamassbasis) of foliar N (5 of 5 transects in Fig. 1); P and Koften fall (3 of 5 transects); but there are no consistenttrends for Ca and Mg. Howeverwhen data fromawiderange of sites are combined, foliar nutrient concentra-tionsshownorelationshipwithaltitudeforN(asfoundfor evergreen woody plants by Ko Èrner [1989]), P, K,Mg, and Ca (Fig. 2). The differences between speci®c
transects and the general pattern shows that one has tobe especially careful to make relevant comparisons forN and P (usually speci®c transects). At any altitude itis possible to ®nd forests with low, intermediate, andhigh concentrations of nutrients, but at any altitudelow-stature forests, especially those where canopyheight is
,10 m, have low concentrations of N and P
(Fig. 3); they also have low concentrations of K, Ca,and Mg (but for these three nutrients there are sometall forests that have low concentrations of these nu-trients).
Insomewaysitmakesmoresensetoexpressnutrient
concentrations per leaf area, because theprimaryfunc-tionofleavesistoabsorblight,whichismostlyaresultof area and only slightly increased by increasing leafthickness.Unfortunatelythenecessarymeasurementofleaf mass per area is only occasionally made. Further-more leaf mass per area varies so much through thecanopy from sun to shade leaves that it is essential tomeasure leaf mass per area on the sample being ana-lyzed for nutrients, and to collect fully sunlit leaves.Nutrient concentrations per mass show little differencebetween sun and shade leaves for N, P, S, Fe, and Cu,while shade leaves have higher concentrations of K,Mg, and Mo (Grubb 1977).
At least two papers present nutrient concentrations
from tropical montane systems by leaf area and mass.In Hawai`i on a mass basis N and P concentrationsdecreased with altitude, but on an area basis concen-trationsincreasedwithaltitudeparticularlyabove1600m (Vitousek et al. 1992). In Puerto Rico, on a massbasisNdecreased,andP,K,Ca,andMgdidnotchangewith increase in altitude, but on an area basis all ®veelements increased with altitude (Medina et al. 1981).In both places leaf mass per area increased with in-crease in altitude. The higher leaf mass per area is inturn correlated with longer-lived leaves in tropicalmontane forests; for example in `Mor Ridge forest' (at1550minJamaica)leaveslastfor18moontheaverage(Tanner 1980)Ðmuch longer than the average leaf lifein tropical lowland rain forests. It seems likely fromthese results that the instantaneous nutrient-use ef®-ciency (the rate of CO
2®xation per unit nutrient) de-
creases with increase in altitude; this is partly due tolower temperatures and partly due to the short-terminef®ciency of sclerophyllous leaves.

fromBruijnzeelandProctor(1993);MuludataarefromProc-tor et al. (1983).Our information on the components of NPP is best for
litterfall, which has been widely measured using rea-sonably comparable techniques. Caution is requiredwhen generalizing from only one of the major com-ponents of NPP, but the patterns are striking. Montaneforests generally have reduced cycling of N and P andoften of K, Ca, and Mg, in comparison with lowlandforests (Grubb 1977, Vitousek 1984). The main reasonfor this is reduced rates of litterfall, but N and P con-centrationsinlitterarelowerinforestsfromthehighest(
.1500 m) altitudes (though concentrations are not
systematically lower at intermediate [1000±1500 m]altitudes;Fig.4).Transectsonthesamemountainshow
lower concentrations of N, butusually not ofP, inlitterat higher altitudes (Fig. 5). Note that the patterns forP concentrations in litter, lower at the highest altitudes(wide range of sites) or no change with altitude (on thesame mountain) contrast with those for foliar P con-centrations, which show no change with altitude (widerange of sites) or fall with altitude (on the same moun-tain). These results con¯ict because the data for singlemountains suggest less retranslocation of P prior toabscission at higher altitude, whereas the pattern froma wide range of sites suggest more retranslocation ofP at high altitude. Clearly more data are needed es-peciallyfromtransectsonthesamemountain(notethatfor P only one site, Silam, is in both Figs. 1 and 5).
In a steady state the amount of a nutrient in litterfall
(per unit ground area per time) is a reasonable ap-proximation to net nutrient uptake into abovegroundparts(perunitgroundareapertime).Basedonlitterfall,

in montane forests (for transects on individual moun-tains [Fig. 6]; though for awide rangeof sitesonmanydifferent mountains thereisnogeneraltrendexceptforlow values of N and P above 1500 m [Fig 4]). For Nand P, and sometimes K, Ca, and Mg, these lowamounts result in low concentrations in the leaves (butthereisaproblemofachickenandeggargumenthere).
AH
YPOTHESIS THAT IN GENERALPLIMITS
GROWTH IN LOWLAND FORESTS AND
NINMONTANE FORESTS
A reasonable speculation from the patterns of foliar
andlitterfallconcentrationsisthatNisinexcesssupplyin most lowland rain forests, a speculation supportedby the relatively high rates of N mineralization andN-containing trace gas emissions from the soils (a by-product of high rates of nitrogen transformations) insuch sites (Matson and Vitousek 1987). In contrast,many tropical montane forests seem to be likely tosuffer from insuf®cient N. A further speculation isthatP is likely to limit growth in a substantial subset oflowland rainforests, and N in many montane forests.
Thus, with regard to N, tropical montane forests ap-
pear to function more like many temperate and borealforeststhanlikemostlowlandtropicalforests.Tropicallowland rain forests produce more litter annually thandomosttemperateforestsÐandinmostcasestheypro-ducelitterwithmuchhigherconcentrationsofN(lowerC:N ratios) than do temperate or boreal forests. Phos-phorus and other major elements (Ca, Mg, K) aremorevariableÐmany tropical forests produce litter withmuch lower concentrations of P than most temperateforests but others produce litter with higher concen-trations(Vitousek1982).Thisvariationamongtropicallowland rain forests is associated with soil type andfertility; tropical forests on highly weatheredclaysoils(oxisols and ultisols) generally produce litter low in P,those on richer soils (i.e., al®sols) produce litter withhigh P concentrations, and those on sandy soils areoften low in N (Vitousek and Sanford 1986).
T
ROPICAL MONTANE SOILS
The decreased nutrient concentrations in leaves and
decreasedcyclingofnutrientsinlitterthatoccurasoneascends tropical mountains could be due to immobi-lization in the soil, which in turn is due to a buildupof soil organic matter resulting from incomplete de-composition. Montane soils usually have more soil or-ganic matter per unit ground area (e.g., in Malaya,Whitmore and Burnham 1969; and in Thailand, Kiraand Shidei 1967); their organic matter is also oftenconcentrated near the top of, or above, the minerallayers of the soil. Another reason for supposing thatnutrient supplies might be limited in montane soils isthat many montane soils are of low pH. (In such soilsthe low pH is a result of the leaching of bases and/orthe high cation-exchange capacity due to the high or-
ganic-matter concentration; low pH is not the cause ofnutrient limitationÐlow pH is caused by the same fac-tors that cause nutrient limitation; pH is easily mea-sured and may indicate nutrient shortage). Often thereis a decrease in nutrient status as one moves from siteswithhighertolowerpH,especiallywhenpHsarebelow5. For example in three ridge-top sites in close prox-imity in Jamaica the surface soil (i.e., pH mea- pH
HO2
sured in water) falls from 4.3 to 3.0 and average foliar
N falls from 1.76% to 1.05% and average foliarPfrom0.10% to 0.05%; the most stunted forest, Mor Ridgeforest,hassoilwiththelowestpH(Tanner1977).How-ever, not all low-pH soils have stunted forests; e.g.,both the extremely stunted forest on East Peak at 1034m in Puerto Rico (Lyford 1969) and the much better
developed El Verde forest at 510 m on the samemoun-tain (Edmisten 1970) have the same surface soil pH(4.3).
If immobilization in soils per se is the cause of low
availability of N, P, K, and Ca, why have trees beenunable to accumulate these elements slowly, over thecenturies, from weathering rock fragments, which areoftenseennearthesurfaceinmontaneforests,andfrominputsinrainfalland/ordust,andfromN®xation?Thisquestion is not speci®c to montane forests; vegetationthroughout the world growing on soils developed frominfertile substrates can be shown to be nutrient limiteddespite millenia of rainfall, dust inputs, and N®xation.The extra nutrients could be insuf®ciently available toplants because of their form or because they are atconcentrations so low as to be unavailable, or becausethe rooting medium somehow limits root uptake. In-frequent but severe disturbance could also lead tolosses of accumulated nutrients. AlternativelyHedinetal. (1995) recently demonstrated that old-growth Chil-eanforestslosedissolvedorganicNinstreamsataboutthe same rate that they receive (mostly inorganic) N inprecipitation; they speculate that losses of dissolvedorganic nitrogen (and dissolved organic phosphorus)could be suf®cient to maintain nutrient limitation inthe long term, at least in unpolluted regions.
Data on levels of instantaneously extractable soil
nutrientsinmontanetropicalforestsarefew,andsome-times show inconsistent patterns with altitude (Bru-ijnzeel and Proctor 1993). Measures of N mineraliza-tion made in Costa Rica showed much reduced ratesat higher altitude (Marrs et al. 1988), which correlatedwithreducedamountsofNcyclinginlitterfallathigheraltitude on the same transect. Extractable and total soilP were lower in sites with higher P nutrient-use ef®-ciency (litterfall dry mass divided by litterfall Pamount) both for all tropical rain forest sites and fortropical montane rain forest sites (Silver 1994), whichsuggests that P may limit growth in many lowland andsome montane sites. Exchangeable basic metals have
been found to both increase and decrease with in-

Proctor 1993). However, there is little evidence that K,Ca,orMglimitgrowthoraffectcompositioninnatural(as opposed to plantation) forests in the tropicsÐa no-table exceptionbeingtheroot-ingrowthexperimentsofCuevas and Medina (1988), which showed that rootsinTierraFirmeforestinsouthernVenezuelagrewpref-erentially into cylinders of vermiculite doped with Ca(or potassium dihydrogen phosphate). The interpreta-tion of this experiment was considerably strengthenedby results from Hawai`i where root growth into bagsdoped with an element was correlated with increasedgrowth causedbyfertilizationwiththatelement(Raichet al. 1994). Thus with a few exceptions the data onextractable soil nutrients do not add much to the in-terpretation based on foliar and litterfall nutrients.Where they are available, soil nutrient data generallysupportthesuggestionthattropicalmontanerain-forestsoils have less available N than many tropical lowlandrain-forest soils though there are some montane siteswhere P is likely to limit growth as well as N.
Bruijnzeel et al. (1993) have suggested that the high
phenolic concentrations in many montane soils mightslow decomposition and plant growth, but there is noexperimentalevidenceforthisasyet.MuchearlierJor-dan et al. (1979) showed that nitri®cation rates in Am-azonian rain forest were suppressed, and they hypoth-esized that this was a result of high tannin concentra-tions in the root mat; they proposed that this limitationof nitri®cation was a way of limiting nitrogen lossesbylimitingtheproductionofhighlymobilenitrateions.
The suggestion that low vapor-pressure de®cit (thedriving force for transpiration) might limit nutrientmovement into leaves due to reduced transpirationwasshown to be incorrect by Medina et al. (1981) whomeasured signi®cant transpiration in the exceptionallystunted forests, which are very frequently clouded, onPico del Este in Puerto Rico. This is the same conclu-sion as that reached by Grubb (1977) who reportedvarious experiments and observations that showed thattranspiration rates were not directly related to theamounts of ions transported, and by Smith (1991) whoreviewedtherelationshipbetweeniontransportandthetranspiration stream and concluded that as the rate of¯ow decreased the concentration in the xylem sap in-creased, thus maintaining a supply of nutrients to evenslowly transpiring leaves. Thus it seems very unlikelythat low rates of transpiration might limit nutrient sup-plies to leaves especially because the highest require-ments will be when leaves are developingÐwhen theyhave very low rates of transpiration because they donot have fully functional stomata and because the airinside buds is near saturation and thus there is almostno driving force for transpiration.
F
ERTILIZATION EXPERIMENTS
Experiments are the only way in which these and
otherpossiblecausesofdecreasedproductivityandnu-trient cycling in montane tropical forests can be ad-
dressed directly. Nutrients are the major resource mostamenable to experimental manipulation, and a numberof fertilization experiments have been carried out inmontane tropical forests. However, the design and in-terpretation of forest fertilization experiments is notalways straightforward, for several reasons.
1) Trees adapted to infertile soils may respond less
to nutrient enrichment than those adapted to more fer-tile soils. Consequently, fertilization of the most nu-trient-de®cient sites may yield only a modest re-sponseÐuntil the dominant species are replaced byothers that are capable of responding to (and may in-deed require) higher levels of nutrients (Chapin et al.1986). The evidence for the importance of this patternis mixedÐfor example,
Pinus nigra will grow on very
infertile soils derived from blown sand in Scotland but
it responds strongly to fertilization(Milleretal.1976);how to interpret these results is unclear, however, be-cause the trees may have come from natural popula-tions growing on relatively fertile soils.
In the experiments that we discuss below there was
often a lag time in response; this was due to the slowresponseoftheindividualspresentwhentheplotswere®rstfertilized,nottothearrivalofspeciesortochangesin species relative abundance.
2) Phosphorus-®xing soils are widespread in tropi-
cal regions (Uehara and Gillman 1981, Sollins et al.1988), and even relatively large additions of this ele-ment may not increase plant-available P signi®cantly.
3) It is dif®cult to measure belowgroundproduction
inforestsÐparticularlyinfertilizedplots,inwhichcal-culations based on CO
2emissions (cf. Raich and Na-
delhoffer1989)areinappropriatebecauseincreasednu-trient availability may affect soil carbon pools withlong turnover times. Increases in response to fertiliza-tion in aboveground production alone may simply re-¯ect reallocation of carbon from belowground.
4) The diversity oftreespeciesinmanytropicalfor-
ests makes it dif®cult to track species-level responsesacross treatment plots of any practical size. The pos-sibility that different species in a site might respond todifferent nutrients further makes it dif®cult to deter-mine ecosystem-level responses.
Despite the potential problems with the interpreta-
tion of fertilization studies, cautious insights can bedrawn from several that have been performed in trop-ical montane forests, mostly in the American tropicsor Hawai`i. In Jamaican montane forest with averagefoliar concentrations of N, P, Ca, and Mg and highconcentrations of K (compared to the range of valuesfor tropical forests in Fig. 2), and low litter concen-trations for N and especially so forP, trunk growthwas77% more following N fertilization, and increased by32% following P fertilization (Table 1).

20 SPECIAL FEATUREEcology
Vol. 79, No. 1
On soils of different ages (and different substrates)
Gerrish et al. (1988), using compound fertilizers,showed that tree-diameter growth was limited on both200-yr-old soil derived from ash, and 1500±3000 yrold soils derived from lava, though it was not on a3400-yr-old soil (also derived from lava but the treesat that site had higher concentrations of N in theirleaves, Table 1). In later experiments with individualnutrients and a larger range of substrate ages (on ash-derived soils) Vitousek and co-workers (Table 1)showedatrendforaswitchfromNlimitationonyoungsoils to P, or N and P, limitation on old soils. On 30-and200-yr-oldashbothtrunkgrowthandlitterfallwereincreased by fertilization with N; on 2000-yr-old ashN fertilization had no effect on either trunk growth orlitterfall; on 4.1 million yr old substrate P increasedtrunk growth and P and N increased litterfall. These
responses to fertilization are consistent with N con-centrations in leaves being lower in the youngest site,but not with P concentrations in leaves, which werealso lowest in the youngest site. The 2000-yr-old sitewhere no responses to N or P were seen had trees withleaves with the highest concentrations of N and P.
Onphysicallydifferent(butchemicallysimilar)sub-
strates different elements limit growth. Raich et al.(1996)showedthattreesgrowingonsoilsderivedfromlava 140 yr old (which weathersslowlytoproducethinsoils) responded to both N and P. In contrast, treesgrowing in soils developed over 200-yr-old unconsol-idated ash (which was chemically similar to the lava)responded to N but not P (Vitousek et al. 1995
a).
The tendency to move from N limitation on younger
soils, especially those that are derived from unconsol-idated substrates, to P and N limitation on older soils,is consistent with the idea that N is accumulated fromthe atmosphere during soil development, while P isderived from the substrate. Thus N accumulatesduringsoil development but P, which is relatively availableinyoung soils, becomes progressively bound up in in-soluble and/or physically protected forms in very oldsoils (Walker and Syers 1976, Crews et al. 1995). It isnot clear whether the results from Venezuela (where Nincreased litterfall and P had no signi®cant effect) andJamaica (where both N and P limited growth) are in-consistent with this; it depends on the age of the soils.In general, in both Venezuela and Jamaica the soilsareoldinthattheyarenotderivedfromgeologicallyrecentvolcanic activity; however, both sites are
;500 m be-
low the current tree line, which was much lower in theice ages, when the sites would havebeenparamo.Bothsites have actively weathering rock fragments
,2m
from the surface and these are probably a source of P.Thus if sites are to pass from N limitation to P limi-tation they probably have to be on deep soils that de-velop over old, nearly level surfaces; the majority ofmontane soils are on slopes where erosion rates haveprobably been suf®cient to ensure that there is alwaysweatherable P accessible to plants. Thus the results
from the experiments carried out so far support thegeneral model of Walker and Syers (1976) that plantproduction should be limited by N on young soils andby P on old soils; N and P supply should more or lessequilibrate on intermediate-aged soils.
C
ONCLUSIONS
Results from this limited set of experiments suggest
thatnutrientlimitationtoabovegroundnetprimarypro-duction may be widespread in montane tropical for-estsÐand that the particular nutrient(s) that limit(s)production may vary among sites for explicable rea-sons. Similar fertilization studies have been started intropical lowland rain forests in Panama and Kaliman-tan. In Panama, Cavelier (1989) showed that fertiliza-tion with N and P together had no effect on litterfallin 4 mo after ®rst fertilization; with hindsight we cansuggest that any effects would have been unlikely toappear in such a short time. In Kalimantan, on sandysoils, N increased girth increment for some trees andN plus P together increased ®ne litterfall 18±24 moafter ®rst fertilization (Mirmanto 1996; J. Proctor
per-
sonal communication ). We await further results from
these studies and from fertilization experiments at twoaltitudes in Puerto Rico with great interest. At presentwehaveinsuf®cientinformationtosaywhetheringen-eral montane forests differ from lowland forests in theextent of nutrient limitation or even which nutrientsgenerally limit growth, despite indirect evidence thatthey might differ in both respects.
Comparisons between responses to fertilization and
foliar or litterfall nutrient concentrations (or soil nu-trients) can only be made for a few sets of data, butobviously such relationships are potentially very valu-able because they tell us to what extent simple(r) mea-sures can be used to detect nutrient limitation (deter-mined by fertilizer experiments). The best data comefrom Hawai`i where
Metrosideros trees with lowest N
concentrations in leaves show the highest increase intrunk growth after fertilization with N; an analogousrelationshipwasnotfoundforP.Theotherexperimentshave much less background information because theyare in much more species-rich forest, in places that aremuch less well studied. We still need many more ex-periments (especially in the lowlands) about the re-sponses to individual nutrients in a range ofsitesÐandclearly negative as well as positive results need to bepublishedÐbefore we can have con®dence about thegeneral patterns of nutrient limitation in tropical mon-tane and lowland forests.

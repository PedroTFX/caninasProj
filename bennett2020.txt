Abstract. Climate change is altering the interactions among plants and soil organisms in
ways that will alter the structure and function of ecosystems. We reviewed the literature anddeveloped a map of studies focused on how the three most common types of mycorrhizal fungi(arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM], ectomycorrhizal [EcM], and ericoid mycorrhizal [ErM] fungi)
respond to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO
2), climatic warming, and
changes in the distribution of precipitation. Broadly, we ask how do mycorrhizal fungi respondto climate change, how do these responses vary by fungal type, and how do mycorrhizal traitsinfluence plant adaptation, movement, or extinction in response to climatic change? First, we
found that 92% of studies were conducted in the northern hemisphere, and plant host, ecosys-
tem type and study location were only correlated with each other in the northern hemispherebecause studies across all mycorrhizal fungal types were only common in the northern hemi-
sphere. Second, we show that temperature and rainfall variability had more variable effects
than eCO
2on mycorrhizal fungal structures, but these effects were context dependent. Third,
while mycorrhizal fungal types vary in their responses to climate change, it appears that warm-ing leads to more variable responses in ectomycorrhizal than in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
Finally, we discuss common traits of mycorrhizal fungi that could aid in fungal and plant
adaption to climate change. We posit that mycorrhizal fungi can buffer plant hosts againstextinction risk, they can facilitate or retard the dispersal success of plants moving away frompoor environments, and, by buffering host plants, they can enable host plant adaptation to
new climates. All of these influences are, however, context dependent a finding that reflects the
complex traits of mycorrhizal fungi as a group, the diversity of plant species they associate withand the variation in ecosystems in which they reside. Overall, while we point out many gaps inour understanding of the influence of climate changes on mycorrhizal fungi, we also highlight
the large number of opportunities for researching plant and mycorrhizal fungal responses to
and mitigation of climate changes.
Key words: climate changes; ecosystems; elevated carbon dioxide; mycorrhizal fungi; plants; precipita-
tion change; warming.
INTRODUCTION
Mycorrhizal fungi can regulate plant distribution and
productivity and are expected to be important players inecosystem responses to, or mitigation of, climate change
drivers (Classen et al. 2015). Mycorrhizal fungi are
poised to have a large impact on ecosystem responses
because they directly influence individual plant functionand indirectly impact processes such as plant dispersal
and community interactions. For example, prior meta-
analyses of one climate change driver, elevated atmo-spheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO
2), found
that eCO 2promoted mycorrhizal fungi (Treseder 2004,Manuscript received 27 June 2019; revised 22 November

Alberton et al. 2005). However, whether this promotion
translated to plant growth promotion was contextdependent and varied with mycorrhizal type (Albertonet al. 2005, Kivlin et al. 2013). Here, we (along with
other authors; Mohan et al. 2014, Tedersoo and Bahram
2019) highlight that none of these previous analysesexamined geographical variation among studies or myc-
orrhizal fungal types.
Mycorrhizal fungi are common on the landscape and
associate with over 80% of plants in a diversity of man-
aged and unmanaged ecosystems (Smith and Read
2008). In fact, there is overwhelming observational andexperimental evidence that mycorrhizal fungi influence a
variety of community traits and ecosystem func-
tions, plant productivity and community composition(van der Heijden et al. 1998, Jiang et al. 2017), decompo-sition, and soil nutrient cycling (Langley et al. 2006,
Rosling et al. 2016), soil microbial community composi-
tion (Kyaschenko et al. 2017) and soil carbon stabiliza-tion, at both local and landscape scales (Clemmensen
et al. 2013, Leifheit et al. 2014, Moore et al. 2015 a,
2015ba,b, Fisher et al. 2016, Jackson et al. 2017). Here,
we explore how the three most common mycorrhizal
fungal types, arbuscular, ectomycorrhizal, and ericoid,
are influenced by and will influence plant abilities toadapt to climate change.
Like all organisms, mycorrhizal fungal groups have
unique suites of traits (Table 1) that mediate the direct
impact of climate change on mycorrhizal fungi (Tresederand Lennon 2015). For example, they vary in hyphal
exploration type (reviewed in Agerer 2001, Helgason and
Fitter 2009, Lilleskov et al. 2011, Peay et al. 2011), andthis variation is linked to root density (Bingham and
Biondini 2009, Peay et al. 2011), disturbance, and nitro-
gen availability (Lilleskov et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2018,Treseder et al. 2018) across mycorrhizal types and at the
species level (Bukovska et al. 2016). Mycorrhizal fungal
species also vary in extra-radical hyphal (ERH) density(Jakobsen et al. 1992, Duan et al. 2011) and turnover (re-viewed in Chagnon et al. 2013) all of which may be
related to species and genotype level variation in hyphalfusion rates (Pepe et al. 2016). These traits, and others,
are responsive to climatic change (Fernandez et al. 2017).For example, mycorrhizal fungi also vary in melanin con-tent (Wright et al. 1996), and increases in mycorrhizal
fungal melanin have been linked to variation in water
availability (Deveautour et al. 2019). Increased melanincan also reduce fungal decomposition (Fernandez et al.
2016, Fernandez and Kennedy 2018) and potentially
reduce carbon storage (Clemmensen et al. 2015), thuslikely feeding back to climate change. In addition, mycor-
rhizal fungi possess genetic variation in helicase activity
(Branco et al. 2017), known to promote cold tolerance infungi. Variation in mycorrhizal fungal traits can also cas-
cade aboveground to alter plant-species-specific growth
rates (Allen et al. 2003, Lopez-Garcia et al. 2014).
Briefly, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form an
obligate association with most herbaceous plant species,
grasses, broad-leaf tree species and occasionally conifers
such as Sequoia sempervirens . In return for carbon, AM
fungi provide nutrients, water, and trace minerals to host
plants. AM fungi are found in every plant habitat, but
generally do not produce fruiting bodies, release sporesbelowground from hyphae and are thus thought to be rel-
atively dispersal limited (Smith and Read 2008), although
this may depend on soil disturbance and spore size (seediscussion in Mycorrhizal fungal responses to climatechange: knowledge and gaps). In contrast, both ectomyc-
orrhizal (EcM) and ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) fungi form
fruiting bodies and often disperse propagules by wind.EcM fungi tend to form associations with a smaller pro-
portion of plant species than AM fungi (Brundrett 2002),
but their impact can scale to the landscape because theytend to associate with regionally dominant tree taxa (Stei-
dinger et al. 2019). Like AM fungi, EcM and ErM fungi
deliver nutrients and water to the host plant in exchangefor carbon. EcM fungi are thought to have a higher host
plant specificity (associate with a smaller range of host
plants) than AM fungi; while most ErM fungi associatewith a narrow group of plants, members of the Eri-
caceae , that are commonly found in ecosystems thought
to be most susceptible to climate and land-use change,

2013). Unlike AM fungi (Davison et al. 2015), both ErMand EcM fungi are not found in all habitats, and their dis-tributions are relatively limited by their host plants and/
or abiotic conditions (Soudzilovskaia et al. 2017). There
is also some overlap between ErM, EcM, and AM fungias some plant hosts associate with multiple fungal types.
Here, we reviewed the geographic distribution of liter-
ature exploring how diverse groups of mycorrhizal fungirespond to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concen-
trations (eCO
2), climatic warming, and changes in the
distribution of precipitation and highlight patterns inthe data as well as gaps in the literature. We end our
review with a discussion of how mycorrhizal fungi, and
their response to climate change, may influence plantresponses to climate change via influencing plant adap-tation, extinction, or dispersal.
M
YCORRHIZAL FUNGAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE :
KNOWLEDGE AND GAPS
Mycorrhizal fungal traits should influence their
response to climatic changes (eCO 2, warming, shifting
precipitation), yet to date there is no comprehensive syn-thesis on how broad groups of mycorrhizal fungi may
respond to different climate drivers. Here we synthesized
t h el i t e r a t u r et od e t e r m i n et h ei n f l u e n c eo fc l i m a t echanges on AM, ErM, and EcM fungi, and identifyknowledge gaps or biases in study geographies as well as
research areas and approaches (File S1). We collected and
synthesized data from the literature on the influence ofwarming, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concen-
trations ([eCO
2]), and increased variability in precipita-
tion on mycorrhizal fungi from manipulative studies. Wefocused our search on precipitation variation and not pre-
cipitation change because recent studies have shown that
rainfall variability and extreme events, not solelyincreased or decreased rainfall, are predicted with climatechanges (Knapp et al. 2015). We conducted four Web of
Science literature searches. Here we focus on unmanaged
ecosystems, thus each of the searches excluded studies inagricultural field systems (NOT “agro* ”NOT “agri* ”).
The first search, 13 October 2017, focused on warming
(TOPIC “warming ”AND “mycorrhiza* ”) and resulted in
251 studies. The second search, (TOPIC “atmospheric
CO2 ”AND “mycorrhiza* ”NOT “bioenergy ”) resulted
in 458 papers, the third search (TOPIC “mycor-
rhiza* ”AND “extreme events ”)r e s u l t e di n2 7p a p e r s ,
and the fourth (TOPIC “mycorrhiza* ”AND “precipita-
tion distribution ”) resulted in 38 papers. We removed
duplicate papers and distilled the remaining papers downto 150 that met our criteria. We recorded whether, at the
last time point of data collection, there was a negative,
positive, or neutral influence of the climate change driveron root colonization, extra-radical hyphae (ERH) in soil,
biomass (most frequently measured using PLFAs), root
community composition (measured with molecular tools),and soil community composition (typically measured withmolecular tools but occasionally measured with spores or
sporocarps). We determined whether the value was nega-tive, positive, or neutral by recording whether there was asignificant difference between treatments recorded in the
paper (nonsignificant differences were recorded as neu-
tral), and, if significant, which direction (positive or nega-tive). We recorded the GPS coordinates for the
geographic study location or where the inocula used in
the study was collected (if the study was conducted in agreenhouse or in a pot). We also collected data on the
type of mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, EcMF, ErMF), plant
host(s) and family, host life history characteristics, habitat(forest, grassland, heath [defined as arctic, alpine, and
other habitats dominated by ericaceous species], shrub-
land, desert, aquatic, or arable), type and/or species ofinocula, and study location (field, greenhouse, or lab).Altogether we collected 300 data lines for mycorrhizal
responses to eCO
2, 152 data lines for warming, and 19
data lines for variability in precipitation (Data S1).
We formed three hypotheses. Similar to other studies
exploring plant ecology, we expect most studies to be
located in the northern hemisphere (according to asearch on Web of Science on 12 October 2018, 19% of
plant ecology studies were conducted in the northern
hemisphere) and in North America and Europe (77%from the same search above). This has been posited intwo other recent reviews as well (Mohan et al. 2014, Ted-
ersoo and Bahram 2019), but not displayed as in this
paper. Second, we expect experimental warming andprecipitation variability studies to have a larger direct
(negative or positive) impact on mycorrhizal fungi across
groups than eCO
2. We hypothesize that temperature and
water availability directly impact soil fungi, whereas
eCO 2impacts fungi indirectly via shifts in plant inputs.
Finally, we expect mycorrhizal fungi that occur inregions most likely impacted by climatic change, e.g.,
ecological range boundaries, arctic ecosystems, to have a
stronger positive or negative response to climate changeexperiments then those in less impacted regions.
Study location
The location of studies on climate changes and mycor-
rhizal fungi (and whether or not studies were in regionslikely to experience the greatest climate change impacts)
and mycorrhizal fungal type will influence our ability as
a scientific community to generalize mycorrhizal fungalresponses to future climate changes. Yet, as hypothe-
sized, the majority of studies we identified were con-
ducted in the northern hemisphere, particularly in NorthAmerica and Europe (Fig. 1). Only 35 experiments fromthree papers (Baon et al. 1994, Plett et al. 2015, Hortal
et al. 2016) were conducted in the southern hemisphere,
and most of these data were collected by one groupworking on EcM fungi (Hawkesbury, New South Wales,
Australia; Plett et al. 2015, Hortal et al. 2016). Studies
of ErM and EcM fungi were mostly conducted in thenorthern latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Not aApril 2020 MYCORRHIZAE CLIMATE STUDY GEOGRAPHY BIAS Article e02978; page 3CONCEPTS &S YNTHESISsingle study was conducted in or using material from
Africa, South America, or south Asia, leaving an exten-
sive knowledge gap about how climate changes may
influence these organisms in areas of the world expectedto be impacted most from climate changes. Further,
ErM fungi were by far the least studied group across all
climate change factors: we identified 11 lines of data col-lected from six climate change studies (warming, eCO
2;
Olsrud et al. 2004, 2010, Arndal et al. 2013, Geml et al.
2015, Asemaninejad et al. 2017, Binet et al. 2017), andall but one (Binet et al. 2017) were conducted in arcticNorth America or Scandinavia. AM and EcM fungi
studies were more common, but study location (field or
greenhouse) varied (Appendix S1: Fig. S1). Most warm-ing studies exploring AM (61%) and EcM (75%) fungal
responses occurred in the field, whereas, eCO
2studies
were more common in greenhouses: only 36% of AMand 31% of EcM studies were conducted in the field.
Our analysis is, however, biased by English language
papers found using Web of Science, and thus may under-represent studies in non-English language journals.
However, the paucity of studies on climate change
impacts on mycorrhizal fungi in non-northern latitudeswas striking.
Plant host and ecosystem types studied were also
biased in our review; the majority of studies across all
mycorrhizal types were conducted on perennial plants(81% of eCO
2studies, 86% of warming studies, and 74%
of rainfall variability studies). This is not entirely sur-
prising given that EcM and ErM associate predomi-nately with perennial plants, and long-term field studies
generally focus on perennial plants. However, even stud-
ies on AM fungi, which often associate with annualplant species, were predominantly conducted on peren-
nials (62% of eCO
2studies, 85% of warming studies, and71% of rainfall variability studies, Appendix S1:
Fig. S2A,B). Also, only 3% of the studies were con-
ducted on C 4plants (Appendix S1: Fig. S2C,D). This is
concerning for a number of reasons: first, annual plantscolonize disturbed habitats and begin succession, thus
this research gap will limit our knowledge of the impact
of climate changes on young and disturbance-proneecosystems and early colonizing plants including inva-
sive species. Second, understanding the AM fungal –C
4
plant relationship may be crucial for climate change mit-
igation, because C 4plants often dominate the tropics
and subtropics where the rate and magnitude of climate
changes are often predicted to be greatest. C 4plants are
known to rely heavily on AM fungi (reviewed in Bennettet al. 2013) and tolerate higher temperatures, but do not
respond as positively to eCO
2(Antoninka et al. 2009).
By contrast, C 3plants may have a higher photosynthesis
rate that does not saturate under tested eCO 2levels.
Thus, an overrepresentation of perennial and C 3plants
associated with AM fungi in research will limit ourunderstanding of AM fungal responses to climate
changes and their role in climate change mitigation.
Most AM fungal studies were conducted in grasslands(55%), all EcM studies were conducted in forests, and allErM studies we found were conducted in heaths
(Appendix S1: Fig. S3). Few studies were conducted in
deserts (Clark et al. 2009, Bell et al. 2014) and non-heathshrublands (Klironomos et al. 1998, Treseder et al. 2003,
Allen et al. 2005). These underrepresented ecosystems
can have diverse AM fungal communities and rare andendemic ectomycorrhizal fungi (Smith and Read 2008),
and thus should be included in research exploring myc-
orrhizal responses to global change.
Many studies did not measure the direct impact of cli-
mate changes on mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizal

FIG. 1. Distribution of studies exploring mycorrhizal responses to climate change overlaid on a map of projected temperature
change in 2050 (Scenario 2.6, IPCC). There are 452 studies across all fungal (ErM, EcM, AM) types, and climate change factors
investigated (warming, eCO 2) represented on the map.Article e02978; page 4 ALISON E. BENNETT AND AIM /C19EE T. CLASSEN Ecology, Vol. 101, No. 4CONCEPTS &S YNTHESIStraits. Most studies (60%) measured root colonization
(Appendix S1: Fig. S4). However, mycorrhizal fungi arelikely to experience climate changes both directly (viaabiotic changes in the soil compartment) and indirectly
(via their host plants in the root compartment; Millar
and Bennett 2016). Combining AM and EcM results, weidentified 26 papers that explored direct and indirect
eCO
2, warming, and altered precipitation effects (see
Data S1), and identified only three studies examiningroot colonization, ERH, and spore production (Klirono-
mos et al. 1996, Antoninka et al. 2009, Yang et al. 2013).
Only a small proportion of studies measured fungi out-side the root: 19% examined ERH and 5% examined
spores or sporocarps. Measuring only one compart-
ment ’s response limits our understanding of fungal
responses to climatic changes, especially fungal fitnessand biomass production.
Studies conducted under different experimental condi-
tions, field or greenhouse, show variable responses tothe impact of eCO
2on mycorrhizal fungi (Fig. 2). Only
three studies (all conducted in the field) examined ErM
fungi. We found that 25% of field manipulations show apositive influence of eCO
2on EcM fungal root coloniza-
tion, whereas 40% of greenhouse studies show a non-
neutral (positive or negative) influence of eCO 2on root
colonization. Only four EcM fungal studies examinedERH in the field, but 20% of greenhouse studies showed
a positive influence of eCO
2on ERH. AM fungal studies
measuring fungi in both root and soil compartmentsfind that root colonization by AM fungi was resilient in
the face of eCO
2as only neutral responses (non-positive
or non-negative effects) have been reported for AM fun-gal root colonization under eCO
2in the field. However,
looking more broadly across all the studies (not just
those that measured both root colonization and ERH)we do not observe this negative/neutral pattern: 36% of
field studies and 45% of greenhouse studies show a posi-
tive influence of eCO
2on root colonization by AM
fungi. Based on studies examining both root coloniza-tion and ERH, AM fungi in the soil compartment may
be more strongly influenced by eCO
2, although these
effects appear stronger under controlled conditions. Thisstrong eCO
2driver of AMF response is supported when
we look across all studies: 25% in the field and 60% in
the greenhouse show a positive influence of eCO 2on
AM fungal ERH. Thus, more studies measuring both
root colonization and ERH need to be conducted to
understand the response of ecosystems to eCO 2.
Climate change type
As predicted by the second hypothesis (both increased
temperature and rainfall variability should have a
greater range (more positive or negative) of effects onmycorrhizal fungi than under ambient conditions), we
found that the effect range (i.e., amount of variability) of
warming effects on mycorrhizal fungi was broader thanfor eCO
2. However, the broadness of the effect rangewas context dependent. Due to the few studies on rain-
fall variability, we only discuss eCO 2and warming stud-
ies. When looking across mycorrhizal measurements, wefound little evidence to support our hypothesis: warm-
ing promoted non-neutral (positive or negative) effects
in 42% of AM fungal, 63% of EcM fungal, and 43% ofErM fungal studies as compared to 44% of AM fungal,
35% of EcM fungal, and 50% of ErM fungal eCO
2stud-
ies. However, when we examined individual measures ofmycorrhizal fungi, we found warming had a greater
range of effects on fungi in both root and soil compart-
ments. Studies measuring both colonization and ERHshowed stronger influences of warming on ERH, but
mostly in the greenhouse and lab. However, few studies
measured ERH in any environment limiting our conclu-sions. Given that temperature likely directly influencesERH, it should not be surprising to observe a more con-
sistent influence of temperature on ERH.
Despite the lack of data dedicated to explaining cli-
mate influences on mycorrhizal fungi, we can gain clues
by looking at the influence of both climate changes and
mycorrhizal fungi on plant growth (often measured as atrait of mycorrhizal fungi). For example, across studies,
mycorrhizal type and nitrogen availability are the pri-
mary factors predicting eCO
2fertilization of plants in
climate change experiments (Terrer et al. 2016). In par-ticular, there were no differences due to nitrogen avail-
ability for plants associated with EcM, but under low
nitrogen availability plants associated with AM fungidid not increase growth in response to eCO
2while AM
fungal plants benefited from eCO 2under high nitrogen
availability. This difference may be related to the stron-ger effects of eCO
2on AM than EcM fungi.
Mycorrhizal type
In contrast to our third hypothesis, we found that
EcM fungi had a more variable response to climatechanges than ErM or AM fungi. For example, as pre-
sented above, overall EcM fungi were more likely to
show a positive or negative response to warming (63%)than eCO
2(35%). To further explore this pattern, we
conducted a small meta-analysis of 11 AM and 7 EcM
fungal studies that measured root colonization underelevated and ambient temperatures.
For this limited meta-analysis, we used studies from a
subset of papers collected for our literature review anddescribed above and in File S1. Studies used in the meta-
analysis needed to measure root colonization in the
greenhouse (due to limited field studies) by both AMfungi and EcM fungi, and provide means or lsmeans,standard deviations or standard errors, and sample sizes.
Studies within papers were considered independent
observations if they were conducted with different plantor mycorrhizal fungal species. We calculated Hedge ’sD
for the difference in colonization between ambient and
elevated temperatures, because of the small study num-bers, the means were continuous variables, and someApril 2020 MYCORRHIZAE CLIMATE STUDY GEOGRAPHY BIAS Article e02978; page 5CONCEPTS &S YNTHESISmeans equaled zero (eliminating the use of the log
response ratio as a potential effect size).
We analyzed variation in effect sizes using OpenMEE
(Wallace et al. 2017). We ran a subgroup continuous ran-
dom effects maximum likelihood model with mycor-
rhizal type (AM or EcM fungi) as the subgroup. Thedata used in the meta-analysis are provided as a datasheet supplementary file (Data S2).
Overall, we found there is a relatively strong positive
effect of temperature on colonization by mycorrhizalfungi (mean Hedge ’sDestimate =0.829, 95%
CI=0.258 –1.399, I
2=68%) driven by a strong positive
effect on colonization by AM fungi (mean Hedge ’sD
estimate =1.369, 95% CI =0.729 –2.009, I2=48%).
There was little overall influence of temperature on colo-
nization by EcM fungi (mean Hedge ’sDesti-
mate=/C00.005, 95% CI =/C00.667 –0.656, I2=53%),
partly due to the range of effects on EcM fungi from
positive to negative while the range of effects for AM
fungi ranged from neutral to positive. There were notenough independent studies to determine what other
factors might have contributed to the greater variation
in EcM fungi root colonization response as compared toAM fungi.
Contrary to our expectations, we found many gaps in
our understanding of how climatic changes influencemycorrhizal fungi. There was only a correlation between
the ecosystem type of mycorrhizal fungal host plants
and different mycorrhizal fungal types in the northernhemisphere, where most of the studies reviewed in this
paper were conducted. In addition, our knowledge gaps
about ErM fungi and rainfall variability likely limit ourability to predict mycorrhizal fungal responses to climatechanges. Also, while both temperature and rainfall vari-
ability have greater effects on mycorrhizal fungi, these
effects are context dependent and will require greaterstudy before we can confidently make predictions about
their impacts. Finally, we incorrectly hypothesized that
mycorrhizal growing season length or host plant typewould influence the likelihood of climate change impacts
on mycorrhizal fungi. Instead, changes driven by direct
fungal structure exposure to climate changes, particu-larly warming, appear to be a stronger predictor of cli-mate change effects on mycorrhizal fungi.

actions between plants and mycorrhizal fungi. A meta-analysis of fungal symbiont influences on plantresponses to climate changes found drought has been
studied two to four times more frequently than other cli-
mate drivers (e.g., eCO
2, warming; Kivlin et al. 2013). In
fact, we conducted a Web of Science search (November
2017) on “drought ”and “mycorrhiza* ”(not “agro* ”or
“agri* ”) resulting in over 62,000 papers. We suspect this
bias is in part because drought can be most easily
manipulated in a short (experimental) time scale com-
pared to other climate drivers (e.g., warming, eCO 2).
Given their different life histories and distributions,
mycorrhizal fungi should have different influences on
plant adaptation to climate change. Plants facing climatechange can either adapt, disperse to a more suitablehabitat, or go extinct. Mycorrhizal fungi could aid or
limit these strategies, and we expect that different mycor-
rhizal fungal types will have traits or limitations that willcause them to contribute differently to these strategies.
Mycorrhizal colonization may buffer plants from
extinction from climate change
Mycorrhizal fungi can increase plant tolerance to abi-
otic stresses associated with climate changes, which
should decrease plant extinction risk and provide timefor plant dispersal and adaptation. For example, AMfungi can alleviate the negative consequences of rainfall
variability (Mohan et al. 2014), due to improved water
flow (Delavaux et al. 2017) via increased water use effi-ciency (Andreo-Jimenez et al. 2015). Increased water
uptake and water use efficiency in AM fungal host
plants can be accomplished by using hyphae to increasesurface area for water absorption (Auge 2001), increased
access to small soil pores (Smith and Read 2008),
improved apoplastic water flow (Barzana et al. 2012),water uptake via fungal water channels (Maurel et al.2015), increased stomatal conductance in host plants
(Auge et al. 2015), altered host gene expression of
drought related genes encoding plant aquaporins (Mau-rel et al. 2015), and promotion of further AM fungal col-
onization (Andreo-Jimenez et al. 2015). Greater rainfall
variability may alter fungal community compositionthrough the loss of mycorrhizal fungal species only toler-
ant of drought or increased moisture leaving only more
plastic fungi that can tolerate both extremes but may ormay not benefit plant partners, which may feedback to
alter plant productivity or plant tolerance to change. For
example, shifts in seasonality coupled with drought canalter both the abundance and community compositionof mycorrhizal fungi (Cregger et al. 2012), which in turn,
impacts plant growth (Lopez-Garcia et al. 2014). Thus,
mycorrhizal fungi can help plants tolerate rainfall vari-ability.
Relative to plants and their roots, mycorrhizal fungi
tend to have a wider temperature tolerance, which mayreflect their ability to produce protective compoundssuch as trehalose (Lekberg et al. 2011, Lenoir et al.
2016). However, mycorrhizal temperature tolerances dif-fer among mycorrhizal type (Kilpelainen et al. 2016)and habitat (Antunes et al. 2011); (but see Bunn et al.
2009), and this variation can benefit host plants. AM
fungal temperature tolerance could promote greater hosttolerance of warming (Bunn et al. 2009, Antunes et al.
2011). Warming can promote both EcM and growth of
EcM associated plants in the field (Deslippe et al. 2011).Warming can also influence host plant associations in
ways that alter mycorrhizal fungal communities, and
these host driven shifts in mycorrhizal fungi, coupledwith changes in soil nutrient availability, could lead to
significant changes in host plant success especially at the
warm edges of plant ranges (Fernandez et al. 2017).
Unlike the other two climate drivers discussed here,
warming and precipitation change, eCO
2may not stress
plant –mycorrhizal-fungae interactions. A recent study
highlighted that, depending on mycorrhizal fungal typeand nutrient availability, mycorrhizal colonization could
boost the impact of eCO
2on plant production via myc-
orrhizal alleviation of nutrient limitation (Terrer et al.2016). In low nutrient ecosystems, only EcM fungi sig-
nificantly stimulated biomass production under eCO
2,
whereas in high nutrient systems both EcM and AMfungi stimulated biomass production under eCO
2. This
result may also be biased by geographic location as most
eCO 2experiments occurred in northern latitudes. Thus
overall, eCO 2should increase growth of mycorrhizal
fungal associated host plants and could promote toler-
ance of other climate change related stresses (Norby and
Zak 2011, Solly et al. 2017).
While there have been few direct comparisons, there is
evidence that mycorrhizal fungal types vary in how
much they buffer plant stress. For example, a meta-anal-ysis found that EcM fungal associated plants had more
context dependent responses to climate change than AM
fungal associated plants (Kivlin et al. 2013). Overall,given their ability to promote abiotic stress tolerance,mycorrhizal fungi should promote tolerance to climate
changes (Kivlin et al. 2013, Mohan et al. 2014), but the
type of mycorrhizal fungi and other stresses will likelymodify the degree of tolerance. This overall promotion
of tolerance to climate changes should reduce plant
extinction even in less than optimal environments, butthis pattern may be biased toward AM fungi.
Potential influence of mycorrhizal fungi on plant dispersal
under climate change
As climates change, plants may need to disperse to
more suitable habitats, and their dispersal success may
depend on mycorrhizal partners (Peay 2016, Wurzburger
et al. 2017). We expect that differences in mycorrhizalfungal distribution and dispersal to influence their host
plant dispersal. For example, the relatively ubiquitous
distribution of AM fungi may comparatively reduceplant dispersal limitations. AM fungi may be dispersalApril 2020 MYCORRHIZAE CLIMATE STUDY GEOGRAPHY BIAS Article e02978; page 7CONCEPTS &S YNTHESISlimited, although spores can be dispersed by wind (Kiv-
lin et al. 2014) and animals (Mangan and Adler 2002,Nielsen et al. 2016), but these dispersal forms may favordifferent fungal groups (e.g., small wind-dispersed
groups or those that form sporocarps), which likely
influences community composition, which in turn, influ-ences plant communities (Mangan and Adler 2002).
However, the presence of any AM fungus, even if not the
perfect partner, should allow AM fungal host plants awider dispersal range. For example, AM fungal associa-
tions have been seen in two extreme examples of plant
dispersal: invasive species (Reinhart and Callaway 2006)and range expanding species (van Grunsven et al. 2014).
Thus, we do not expect AM fungi to limit plant disper-
sal.
In contrast to AM fungi, lack of EcM fungi can limit
plant dispersal. For example, work on invasive pines
clearly shows invasion can be limited by EcM dispersal
(e.g., Nunez et al. 2009). Shrubs are expanding in theArctic under warming and this expansion is coupled
with changes in nutrient cycling and ErM and EcM
community compositions (Timling et al. 2012, Gemlet al. 2016). The EcM fungi in the Arctic tend to be cos-
mopolitan and can grow at very low temperatures, thus
shifts with warming may reduce the cold-tolerant cos-mopolitan fungi and alter this community ’s ability to
facilitate changes with warming (Timling and Taylor
2012). For example, many studies exploring warming in
the Arctic find that EcM species of Russula increasedwith warming while other species decline, which could
feedback to impact plant growth over time (Deslippe
et al. 2011, 2012, Geml et al. 2016). However, when EcMfungi are present warming may promote EcM fungal
and shrub expansion (Deslippe et al. 2011, Solly et al.
2017). In addition to lack of inocula, dispersal by Erica-ceous plants was hindered by their environmental abiotic
conditions. Yet, under the right abiotic conditions, such
as high soil moisture, EcM and ErM fungi respondquickly to warming with significant shifts in their com-munity composition (Geml et al. 2016). As a result, we
can expect faster dispersal by plants hosting AM fungi
in response to climate changes than host plants of ErMor EcM fungi, but the specificity of fungal associations
and the shifts in community composition described
above across all mycorrhizal fungal types may limitplant productivity in new environments.
Mycorrhizal fungi may promote adaptation of host plants
We expect all three mycorrhizal types to increase the
likelihood of plant adaptation to climate changes. Inparticular, the promotion of stress tolerance by mycor-
rhizal fungi should allow temporal space for plant adap-
tation to climate changes. As a result, we expect thatmycorrhizal fungi act as a buffer for plants that find
themselves in environments altered by climate change,
thereby increasing their “niche ”(Peay 2016, Gerz et al.
2018). Under conditions where environmental variationis common, this “buffering ”could allow plants to
increase their fitness in suboptimal years; however, this“buffering ”could become crucial when climate changes
faster than plants can disperse or adapt to their new
environment. If mycorrhizal fungi buffer plants against
climate changes, then we would expect overall reducedrates of plant extinction and greater prevalence of adap-
tation in affected environments than expected when we
do not account for mycorrhizal fungi. Specifically, itcould allow plant species the time needed to adapt to
their new environmental conditions.
C
ONCLUSIONS
Here, we highlighted the importance of examining both
the response of mycorrhizal fungi and the response of
plants associated with mycorrhizal fungi to climate
changes; however, the vast majority of studies have, todate, focused on the interaction between these two groups
of organisms. As a result, we do not know if the responses
of mycorrhizal fungi themselves to future climate changeswill limit their promotion of plant tolerance to those same
climate changes. Climate changes could also influence dis-
persal of fungi thereby limiting plant dispersal, and inother cases, we could see phenological shifts in develop-
ment of fungi and plants that could lead to mismatches
that could limit plant productivity and ecosystem services.Some studies separating influences on plants and fungihave pioneered this area of research (Barrett et al. 2014),
but there are many opportunities for increasing our
understanding of both plant and mycorrhizal fungalresponses to climate changes.
